# Air_In_China

a spider (or crawler) based on python3, which is to craw air data from Chinese official website(<http://106.37.208.233:20035>) developed with Silverlight from Micrsoft.And meantime it's a part of my campus SRTP project.

本项目是一个基于python3且从全国城市空气质量发布平台上的Silverlight中爬取的空气质量数据，同时也是我的一个SRTP项目中的一部分。

## INTRODUCTION

some usage examples had been included( SiteSpider.py, CityDaySpider.py, CityRealTimeSpider.py). you can know how it can be used.

项目中给出了几个函数的例子，借鉴即可了解如何使用。

Because net communication between Silverlight is wcfbin message, and there is a base64-encrypted process before data being deflated. Wcfbin message can be solved from [ernw/python-wcfbin](https://github.com/ernw/python-wcfbin) .

因为Silverlight中的小心通讯是使用wcfbin格式的，所以可以使用Github上的一个开源项目来解决这个问题[ernw/python-wcfbin](https://github.com/ernw/python-wcfbin) 。而且在通讯压缩数据前还有一个base64加密的过程。

This project is a try on python, i'm sorry fot that there maybe are some problems in language using or model designing. 

本项目是一个在python上的尝试，所以可能有一些语言使用或者模式设计上的问题，对此我很抱歉。
